# Pkedex
- My first website using Class Based Components!
- a small application where users can play a small pokemon cards game from the pre-set pokemons.Used a third party API for the image src.

## Figma
I used figma come up with the design idea for this application, as to give me a more clear picture on how the site should look!

## Next Stpes
Lokking into adding more Pokemons using a third party API instead of just getting the data for the images.
